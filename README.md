# Case Management

## Instructions

You are working on a case management application that has a “case overview” page, containing information such as case numbers, demographics, etc. The data for a single case can come from multiple different agencies (e.g. John Doe Medical Office, Linda Hospital).

Your task is to conceptualize and implement some sort of way to list/display all of the agencies that have contributed data to this case. Please use a modern framework such as React.js (preferred), or Bootstrap. You can assume there can be more than 10 agencies contributing data to a single case.


## Local Environment Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `json-server --watch db.json`     
Create a local server on localhost:3000/{server_name}
