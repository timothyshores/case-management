# Case Management

You are working on a case management application that has a “case overview” page, containing information such as case numbers, demographics, etc. The data for a single case can come from multiple different agencies (e.g. John Doe Medical Office, Linda Hospital).

Your task is to conceptualize and implement some sort of way to list/display all of the agencies that have contributed data to this case. Please use a modern framework such as React.js (preferred), or Bootstrap.

You can assume there can be more than 10 agencies contributing data to a single case.

Please provide your code files and any additional text files you feel inclined to provide (such as explanation of thought process, etc.). We will discuss your result in a follow-up phone call.
